Organizational Structure:

Organization Structure Module

Description: This module defines how the company is organized. It allows the System Administrator to
create departments and positions, update them when changes happen, and deactivate positions that are
no longer needed while keeping their history. Managers can request changes to reporting lines or positions,
and these requests go through an approval process to keep the structure accurate and logical. Role-based
views allow employees and managers to see the org chart appropriately. Changes automatically update
dependent modules (e.g., Payroll, Recruitment, Employee Profiles) to keep data consistent.


Organization Structure Flow

The Organizational Structure Management (OSM) Module governs how departments, positions,
and hierarchical structures are created, updated, and maintained across the HR system. This ensures that
the organizational framework remains accurate and aligned with operational and administrative needs,
serving as a foundation for recruitment, payroll, and performance processes.

Phase 1: Structure Definition The process begins when the System Administrator defines and
creates new organizational entities such as departments or positions. These additions accommodate new
roles within the company hierarchy. Each position is linked to a department and assigned its relevant
attributes including identification codes, reporting lines, and pay grades. Once created, the position
becomes available for recruitment and integration into downstream HR functions.

Phase 2: Structural Maintenance When modifications are needed, the System Administrator
performs direct updates or maintenance of existing departments and positions. This may include renaming, reassigning, or updating attributes such as reporting structures or pay grades. Structural changes
are applied immediately across the system to maintain data consistency between the organizational structure and dependent subsystems.

Phase 3: Deactivation and Synchronization When a position or department becomes obsolete,
the System Administrator deactivates it from the active structure. Positions with historical employee
records are not deleted but are delimited—meaning they are closed as of a certain date—to preserve
organizational history. These updates ensure the system retains full historical accuracy while keeping the
active organizational chart current and synchronized across all modules.

Performance Module

Description: This module is designed to manage the complete employee appraisal (evaluation) cycle in
a structured, transparent, and automated way. Its main aim is to help HR teams, Department managers,
and employees participate in fair and consistent performance evaluations that follow standardized rules
and processes.

Requirements, Dependencies, and Business Rules

Performance Flow

The Performance Appraisal Management Module manages the complete lifecycle of employee
evaluations, ensuring a structured, fair, and transparent appraisal process. It integrates multiple stages
from template creation to final archivingâwhile supporting collaboration between HR, managers, and
employees.

Phase 1: Planning and Setup The process begins when the HR Manager defines standardized
appraisal templates. These templates establish the rating scales, evaluation criteria, and appraisal types
(such as annual or probationary), which are then assigned to specific departments or organizational
units. After the templates are finalized, the HR Manager or HR Employee sets up the appraisal
cycle, defining its duration, start and end dates, and assigning the appropriate templates to relevant
managers. The organizational structure data determines reviewer hierarchies and reporting lines for each
employee.

Phase 2: Evaluation and Review During the active appraisal cycle, each Department Manager
evaluates assigned employees using the approved templates. The manager provides performance ratings,
qualitative comments, and development recommendations. Attendance and punctuality information from
the Time Management module may also inform the assessment. Throughout this phase, the HR Manager
monitors progress through a centralized dashboard, ensuring timely completion of appraisals. Once all
evaluations are finalized, HR publishes the official results to employees.

Phase 3: Feedback and Acknowledgment Following publication, the Employee reviews their appraisal results, including performance ratings, comments, and development notes. The system automatically saves the complete appraisal record within the employee profile, maintaining a historical record of
performance outcomes for future reference and analytics.

Phase 4: Dispute and Resolution After receiving results, employees are granted a defined period to
raise objections or appeal their evaluations. If a dispute is submitted, it is routed to the HR Manager
for review. The HR Manager may either uphold the original assessment or adjust the final rating based
on the justification provided. Once resolved, the decision is logged and the finalized rating updated in
the system.


Phase 5: Closure and Archiving When all evaluations and disputes are complete, the system automatically archives the finalized appraisal data. Historical appraisal records become accessible for reference, reporting, and performance trend analysis. This ensures long-term data integrity and supports
evidence-based HR decision-making across appraisal cycles.
